# Anomaly-Detection
Dectecting anomalies in Tweet volumes about Apple

In this project we will be using a dataset that contains the daily volume of tweets about Apple and using this to detect anomalies. This data set can be downloaded from here: https://www.kaggle.com/boltzmannbrain/nab It contains a timestamp and a value column. The value column corresponds to the number of tweets about Apple at a certain time. We will be looking at anomalies in volume of tweets in intraday time periods and also in daily time periods. We will be using a couple different methods of classifing anomalies. Then we will evaluate which method is better for detecting anomalies on our dataset.
